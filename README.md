# Pseudo-Pokedex
NOTE: The Pakudex is similar to how a Pokedex functions from Pokemon!

## Purpose
The "Pseudo Pokedex" project provides me with valuable practice in building and working with object-oriented programming constructs, with a specific emphasis on implementing classes and objects. My focus within the project revolves around creating classes that symbolize the magical creatures known as Pakuri. Additionally, I am tasked with developing a cataloging system aimed at effectively managing and organizing these whimsical creatures.

## Project Significance 
The project's key goal is to create a "Pakudex," an indexing system for players, addressing the challenge of managing numerous Pakuri creatures. By applying object-oriented programming concepts, I'll contribute to developing a virtual system reminiscent of the iconic Pokedex, offering an engaging and educational coding experience.
